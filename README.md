# SimpleRaytracer

This is my implemebtation of a brute force Monte carlo raytracer following the famous "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.

# Geometry.h
This header file contains all the types definitions that are used in the Raytracing algorithm. Mainly the generic vector type that
is used for directions vectors and colors.

# Raytracer.cpp
This is the implementation of the main algorithm, in addition to other functions that it uses.

# Material.h
To support different lighting models, this is where materials are defined.

Geometry and Material were added to the project in order to support different lighting models and complex geometry.
